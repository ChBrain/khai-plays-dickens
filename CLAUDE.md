# CLAUDE.md, the Dickens house

This is the Dickens production house (`khai-plays-dickens`), raised by
khai-stage. The plays are written separately, in khai-playwright mode.

**Voice first.** Operate under the
[management instructions](management/management_instructions.md): the khai
**voice and mechanics** (who speaks, the company, management orders). _Then_ this
file is the **coding contract** for the house. Voice and mechanics there; coding
rules here. The order matters: management voice first, coding second.

## Branching

Computed, not chosen. Let the guard pick the lane:

```
npx khai-guard branch <topic>
```

- `play/<topic>` owns `plays/**` (the productions).
- `governance/<topic>` owns the gates and config (`.github/**`, `.husky/**`,
  `khai-guard.config.json`, `tests/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `REFERENCES.md`, `management/**`).
- `changeset-release/*` is a bot-controlled general lane for version releases.

A **management order** (`management/orders/**`) is a **rider**: an order directs
work in any lane, so it rides the lane of the change it drives. Write the order
beside that change and the guard folds both onto one branch (an order that
restages a play lands as one `play/` PR); committed alone, an order homes to
`governance/`. So an order and the change it commands are one PR, never two.

Never `--no-verify`. Never merge; open the PR and stop.

## Versioning

The minor version IS the play count, computed not chosen; the **Version Packages**
PR is the deploy gate every release passes through. The `version` script runs
`npx khai-tests registry build`, which sets the version from the play count:
`0.<count>.0` (the minor is the count, the patch resets to 0), reconciling both
`package.json` and `registry.json`. The build is the single writer of the version
number; never hand-edit it.

- **Adding a play** -> a `minor` changeset. The play PR carries it, so the deploy
  is steered through the Version Packages PR and the CHANGELOG names the play.
  `changeset version` bumps the minor and the build reconciles it back to the play
  count, resetting the patch to 0 (`0.<count>.0`). It **must** be `minor`: a
  `patch` (or empty) changeset survives the reconcile (count === minor) and drifts
  the version to `0.<count>.1`, so the `changeset-check` gate rejects it.
- **A fix to existing content** (ships package `files`) -> a `patch` changeset; it
  ships at the same play count (`0.<count>.1`).
- **A change that ships nothing** (governance, tooling, docs, tests) -> an
  **empty** changeset (`npx changeset add --empty`); it records the PR and merges
  green without republishing identical content.

A non-zero major resets the minor while the count keeps climbing, so a house
stays `0.x`; the numbering guard rejects a major bump.
